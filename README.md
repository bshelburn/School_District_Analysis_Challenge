# School District Analysis Challenge
---
## Overview of District Analysis
Performed an analysis for Maria and the school board due to apperent acedemic dishonestly specific to the 9th grade reading and math grades from Thomas High School.   Analysis was performed and created multiple easy to digest charts showing the new caluclations and impact of removing the ninth grade numbers.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to uphold state state testing standards by eliminating any potential acedemic dishonsty.   This was done by eliminating the scores (grades) of the 9th grade from Thomas High School for reading and math but leaving the rest of the data set in tact.

  * Although there was a very slight decrease in the overall district average math score and passing percentage due to the large sample size the exclusions of the 9t grade of the small charter school had minimal impact on overall performance.
  * Other slight differences in the metrics can be attributed to rounding rules.

  * Very similar to the overall results shown above the difference in scores is minimal.
  * The average math score, passing percentage, and overall passing percentage dropped slightly with the exclusion of 9th grade from THS.

## District Analysis Summary
There was minimal amount of impact by removing the few hundred students that were in 9th grade.   Despite the claims of potential acedemic dishonesty I did not discover anythng specific to corroberate the claim.   The THS charter school was among one of the smallest within the all over sample size.   However the charter schools did seem to rank higher in terms if all over performance in terms of the summary snapshots of grades.   That being said they have much smaller class sizes and dedicate more money per head to each individual.
